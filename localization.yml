# Configuration for Range-image-based Monte Carlo Localization

# Inputs
# the folder of raw LiDAR scans

# map poses calibration file
map_calib_file: '../data/07/calib.txt'
# ground truth poses file

# Output
# path to save localization results

# plot the final localization results
plot_loc_results: True

# MCL parameters
# pose tracking or global localization

# when the number of occupied tile map is smaller than the threshold,
# we say the localization converged.

# after convergence, we reduce the number of particles
# and using only num_reduced particles.
